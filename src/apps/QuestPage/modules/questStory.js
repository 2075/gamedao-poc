		'Shall we play a game?\n' +
		'\n' +
		'No, not chess.\n' +
		'\n' +
		'Something much, much better.\n' +
		'Something only YOU have in mind.\n' +
		'\n' +
		'But for this game, you’ll need a team of allies.\n' +
		'And you’ll need some money. \n' +
		'It’s always about money isn’t it?\n' +
		'\n' +
		'But you just want to have fun.\n' +
		'\n' +
		'Fear not. Follow Hawkins on these six quests, and she’ll help you get there.\n',

	1: 'Cha-ching, baby!\n' +
		'// Connect your wallet and get tokens\n' +
		'\n' +
		'You power up your Commodore 64 and slide on your VR goggles.\n' +

		'Hawkins waits for you inside 80s world, then takes you to an old-time video arcade, the kind they used to have in crowded places called shopping malls. You follow her through a maze of 8-bit cabinet games like Pac-Man, Galaga, and Joust. All around, machines ding and blip and chime with joy as players rack up high scores. Hawkins leads you past a row of pinball games to the change machine in the back. You step aside as she inserts a bill into the slot. Golden game tokens tumble into a metal cup, adding delightful clangs to the ambient digital noise.\n' +
		'As you fiddle with the red shag carpet on the wall, you notice a CASSETTE tape resting atop the coin machine.\n' +
		'Hawkins grabs her fistful of coins.\n' +
		'But you still have none.\n' +
		'“Hawkins,” you say. “My wallet’s empty.”\n' +
		'“Ah, yes, that’s a common problem,” she says. “Let me show you to the faucet.”\n',

	2: 'I’ve not seen such bravery!\n' +
		'Create a DAO\n' +
		'\n' +
		'“Great, you have tokens,” Hawkins says. “Grab that cassette tape, cos you’ll need a DAO.”\n' +
		'“What’s a DAO?” you ask. \n' +
		'“Technically, it means ‘decentralised autonomous organisation’.”\n' +
		'“You lost me, Hawkins.”\n' +
		'“You know how arcades are. Everyone wants to play and nobody’s in charge, but we have to maintain order. What happens when you’re playing a game and someone wants to be next?”\n' +
		'“They put a token on the corner of the cabinet to let you know.”\n' +
		'“Right. You don’t even have to talk about it, cos you know they’re next. If you wanted to play three more times, you woulda put three tokens up in the corner before you started to let everyone know. The rules are unspoken. That’s kinda how DAOs work. Except they use things like code written on blockchain to establish and enforce the rules.”\n' +
		'“But why do I need a DAO if I just want to play?”\n' +
		'“You don’t, but you’ll thank me if you do.”\n' +
		'“Alrighty, I trust you.” You pop your tape into the DATASETTE PLAYER  on your desktop and press play. “Let’s do this.”\n',

	3: 'Rally thine allies!\n' +
		'Invite two friends into your DAO\n' +
		'\n' +
		'Hawkins says, “Now choose a game to play.”\n' +
		'“I saw one I’d like to try.”\n' +
		'“Oh, really, where?”\n' +
		'You point at Gauntlet.\n' +
		'“That’s fun for sure!” A big smile spreads across her face. “You could play alone, but you’d be going up against all the enemies by yourself. Or you and I could play together… I call dibs on green wizard. We might do alright as partners, but that’s a four-player game. It’s more fun with friends, cos everyone works together to defeat the ghosts, demons, and thieves. Believe me, they can be tricky.”\n' +
		'“Hey, I have friends,” you say. “I saw two of them around here somewhere.”\n' +
		'“Great, call them over.”\n' +
		'You tap away at your KEYBOARD and send the invites.\n',

	4: 'Level up, warrior!\n' +
		'Create a fundraising campaign\n' +
		'After making the Gauntlet leaderboard, you all high-five and slap each other on the back.\n' +
		'Without even thinking, you blurt, “I wish we could play as the bad guys.”\n' +
		'“That’s brilliant, dude!” your friends say. And soon ideas start whizzing around faster than elf arrows. What if we could upgrade our weapons? What if we took the game online? What if we made an MMORPG where people could play as either good or bad guys?\n' +
		'It’s so very exciting.\n' +
		'“Green wizard needs food badly,” Hawkins jokes.\n' +
		'So you all go to the food court to grab a slice of pizza and a Coke.\n' +
		'Your friends flood your MONITOR as they text you even more ideas. Others witness the online chatter, and come join your DAO. Everyone agrees your game should have gorgeous art, an intriguing story, and solid script…\n' +
		'You ask, “Can anyone draw, write, or code?”\n' +
		'Nope. Crickets.\n' +
		'You sigh. “If only we had the money to hire people.”\n' +
		'“This is a fabulous game idea,” Hawkins says. “You should totally create a fundraising campaign.”\n',

	5: 'Get cash in your stash!\n' +
		'Collect campaign funds\n' +
		'“But I don’t know anything about fundraising,” you groan. “It sounds awful.”\n' +
		'Your friends are already in love with the concept and pledge a quarter of what they have in their wallets to get started. Of course, you pitch in too. \n' +
		'And just like that, your DAO is already off to a healthy start.\n' +
		'“I think your game idea rocks!” Hawkins offers you ten tokens to start developing it. “We should all tell our friends about this game and see if they want to contribute too.”\n' +
		'“People do that?” you ask.\n' +
		'“They sure do, and it’s called crowd-funding.” She laughs. “I invest in all kinds of game projects. That’s why I like hanging out in the arcade. I’m gonna head back there now. But grab your JOYSTICK to navigate through the money maze without me. You got this.”\n',

	6: 'Name your game!\n' +
		'Proof of existence\n' +
		'Write proposal to withdraw funds\n' +
		'\n' +
		'A few weeks later you meet up with Hawkins in 80s world to thank her.\n' +
		'You gasp, “I can’t believe we raised all the money.”\n' +
		'“I believe it! I knew you had a great idea,” Hawkins says. “And now that you’ve reached your campaign goals, you’ve proven that you not only can play games, but that you and your team are true visionaries.”\n' +
		'“And our DAO membership has grown beyond our wildest dreams!”\n' +
		'“All that’s left is to write a summary that introduces your game to even more people.”\n' +
		'“Oh, I don’t know how,” you say.\n' +
		'“GameDAO will guide you through your proposal.” [link here]\n' +
		'“Really?”\n' +
		'“Yup, really.”\n' +
		'“Then what?”\n' +
		'“One step at a time, my friend.” She hands you a model DELOREAN to remember her by. “And there’s only one more to go.”\n',
