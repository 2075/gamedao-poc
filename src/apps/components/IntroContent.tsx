		Fundraising is generally split into two phases:
		<br />
		<br />
		1. the fundraising phase, where you promote your project and collect supporters with their funding.
		<br />
		2. The project phase, where you need to decide in advance, how you want to release the raised funding:
		<br />
		<br />
		Depending on the protocol ( Grant, Prepaid, Loan, Share ) the raised funds can be released in various ways, giving your supporters different types of
		guarantees and influence opportunity along the process of creating your project. If you choose to use DAO Governance, you will propose either milestones
		or deliverables which in turn release funds, when the DAO approves. If you don't utilise DAO Governance, the funding protocol will determine, how funds
		are paid to you:
		<br />
		<br />
		A Grants pay immediately to you, the creator.
		<br />
		B Prepaid campaigns release payments on a vesting schedule.
		<br />
		(C Loans will release immediately to you, the creator.)
		<br />
		(D Shares will immediately release, but imply further regulatory requirements.)
		<br />
