# GameDAO BETA

GameDAO is a EU based community owned and governed DAO providing community centric protocols:

- building unstoppable organizations
- community shared ownership
- fundraising and project curation
- coordination to organize and prioritize and coordinate use of funds
- nft based governance gamification
- amm / defi / lending
protocols.

These enable crowdfunding and governance protocols and aim at videogame creators and players, creators and eSports communities.

GameDAO as a dApp is running on [ZERO.IO](https://zero.io), a substrate based multichain network for the Metaverse featuring unique, decentralised protocols for the videogames industry.

This is a proof of concept dApp featuring fundraising, governance and other functionality, inspired by [Substrate Frontend Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template).

Expect things to break and sub par production quality code, if you are checking it out.
Also, check out https://github.com/gamedaoco/subzero for rust based modules running on zero network.
